The Waterfall Model in Software Engineering, which follows a sequential design process. Here’s a breakdown of each phase: 

*Phases of the Waterfall Model: 

	1. Requirements – Gather and document all system requirements. 

	2. Design – Create the system architecture and design specifications. 

	3. Development – Write the actual code based on the design. 

	4. Testing – Verify that the software functions correctly. 

	5. Deployment – Release the software to the end users. 

	6. Maintenance – Fix bugs, update features, and ensure smooth operation. 

Key Characteristics: 

	`Linear and Sequential: Each phase must be completed before moving to the next. 

	`Documentation Heavy: Every step is well-documented. 

	`Best for Stable Projects: Works well when requirements are clear and unlikely to change.
